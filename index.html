             <p>
                The term "Space" or "Outer Space" means the area                    around Earth. Outer space is very big, vast and full                 of galaxies and planets. Compared to outer space, we                 are just a speck of matter in a big galaxy.

              <h2>Our Solar System</h2>  
                <p>
                    Our solar system is made out of 8 planets:                          Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,                       Uranus and Neptune (In Order). Our Sun is the                       star that gives us light, heat and energy.                          Jupiter is the biggest planet in the solar                          system, Venus is the hottest and Uranus is the                      coldest. The sun's surface temprature is 10                         ,000째F (5,500째C) and the sun's core is 27                           million째F (15 million째)

               <p>
                   Outer space is full of galaxies. We are in a                        galaxy called the Milky Way Galaxy. A galaxy is a                    cluster of millions and billlions of planets,                       stars and more held together by gravitational                       force.

               <h2>Matter</h2>
               <p>
                  Everything in outer space is made from matter.                    Matter is what we are made of, what the universe is                 made of, what everything is made of. Matter is                      universes to galaxies to planets to atoms and to                    subatomic particles. There are 4 types of matter:                   Solid, Liquid, Gas and Plasma. Solids have a                        definite shape and volume, liquid has a definite                    volume but not a definite shape as they take the                    shape of their container, gas has neither definite                  shape or volume and plasma is extremly heated gas.
